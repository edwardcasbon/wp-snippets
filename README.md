# Snippets

A WordPress plugin that allows users to use and update snippets of content across their Wordpress website.

## Getting and installing

You can download the latest version from here:

https://github.com/edwardcasbon/wp-snippets/

To use on your own WordPress website, download the plugin and place the 'snippets' directory into your Wordpress plugins directory (usually '/wp-content/plugins/').

Once you've installed the plugin, activate it and you'll see a new 'Snippets' area where you can add snippets of content for you to re-use across the website.

After adding a snippet, you can add it to any post/page by visiting the edit screen for that page and selecting it from the 'Snippets' menu in the side bar.

Enjoy :)
